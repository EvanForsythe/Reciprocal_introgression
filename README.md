# Reciprocal_introgression
code for simulating and testing reciprocal introgression events

## Intended use of this repo

We will use the repo to:
* Learn how to setup a GitHub repo and utilize it for the development of this project.
* Simulate introgression events and generate mulitple sequence alignments from these simulations
* Measure introgression statistics (e.g. D-statistics) on these simulated datasets.
